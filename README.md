# Pollywog Ranch

## Goal

Help Frog Rancher Darryl categorize and track all the ponds, frogs, and tadpoles on his ranch. To do this you will create migrations and models complete with ActiveRecord associations.

## Background 

After speaking with Darryl he has informed us that he has several ponds on his ranch. Each pond has different frogs that live there. Some of those frogs have tadpole babies. The frogs all have the ability to have tadpoles at any given time and the tadpoles have the ability to metamorphosize into frogs at any time. 

## Example

Here's a [demo](http://the-pollywog-ranch.herokuapp.com/) of what we're aiming for.

## Instructions

#### Getting Started
* Run `bundle install` then `rspec` to see what course to take. Keep in mind that for the association of tadpoles belonging to a pond through frog, you'll have to [delegate](http://stackoverflow.com/a/11457714).
* Take a look at the tests in `spec/models` before writing your migrations. 
* Once you mirgrations are done, start on the models.
* Once the models are built, add the ActiveRecord associations.
* If you get stuck refer to [Rails Active Record Documentation](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html) or take a look at the included solution branch with completed code.
* You can refer to this link as a quick reference for the Rails 4 folder structure along the way [here](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby-on-rails/rails-directory-structure.htm).

#### Running the App Locally
* When your finished and all the specs are passing, go ahead and run the following commands from your terminal:
  * rake db:migrate
  * rake db:seed
  * rails s
* Then hit up the app [here](http://localhost:3000/).

#### Critical Thinking
* Think about how you would get a tadpole to metamorphosize. Click on any tadpole and make it metamorphosize. Did the app go about metamorphosizing tadpoles in the same way you would have? For more details about metamorphosize into a frog, see `config/routes.rb` and `app/controllers/tadpoles_controller.rb`.
* Think about how you would get a frog to have tadpole babies. Click on any frog and make it have a baby. Did the app go about making baby tadpoles in the same way you would have? For more details about metamorphosize into a frog, see `config/routes.rb` and `views/frogs/show.html.erb`. You can learn more about nested resources below.
